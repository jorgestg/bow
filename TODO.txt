- I need to change the syntax node for struct and enum declarations to use a MemberSyntax superclass instead
  of splitting fields and methods, that way I get rid of the slot hack.

- Rename: Else [if] clause -> else [if] block

- Struct creation expression on the parser and grammar

- Remove isLHS from block
